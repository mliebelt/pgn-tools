# PGN Tools

Collection of useful functions / commands that combine different functions from pgn-parser, pgn-reader, pgn-writer.

## Goals

I have developed over years many different tools in the context of PGN, but combining them is not always easy. I don't want to have additional dependencies, so I want to have a collection of small functions that can be used in different projects.

So the pgn-tools will do the following:

* Provide Javascript/Typescript functions that can be used in any project.
* Provide a command line tool that can be used in any shell.
* Provide useful subcommands with different options per subcommand.
